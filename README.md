**The Problem**

Nanyang Technological University uses Blackboard to connect lecturers and students. 
Blackboard allows the lecturer to post lecture slides, past quizzes and exams, eLearning material, course guidelines, and more. 
However, it does not have a feature that allows the lecturers and students to communicate with each other effectively on the application. 
The only method for students to contact the lecturer after class is email communication. 
As a result, students often find it difficult to communicate with peers taking the same courses when they are facing difficulties in their studies.

**Solution**

Whiteboard is an online gathering place where students can ask, answer, and explore course-related material at any time of the day under the guidance of their instructors, allowing for constant, easy communication between students and instructors.
